# Centrects-Public-Code
Welcome to my GitHub repository!

Here I will post all my code that I decide to make public. It contains code from some of my many Minecraft servers.
Please read over the terms and conditions listed below before making any downloads or utilizing any of the products on this page.  

# Note

Most of the code that I upload here will not be user-friendly. What I mean by that is it won't have "options" at the top of the code, you will have to go through the code and change the bits yourself. This is because I do not design these skripts for redistribution, but rather for my personal use. 


# Terms And Conditions:
I, Centrect, Reserve the right to revoke your licence to my code at any point, for any reason, and without notice. You are not allowed to redistrubute my work under any circumstances without permission granted first. All use must be personal only, and credit must be given where it is due. Usage of any of the products that I post here must not be for commercial use without permission granted. I reserve the right to forcefully remove any product of mine from your posession, this includes all platforms, public and private. By utilizing the products on this page you automatically agree to these terms.
